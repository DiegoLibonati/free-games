# Free Games

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Description

**Free Games** is a full-stack web application that lets users discover, explore, and save free-to-play games from across all platforms and genres.

The app consumes the [FreeToGame API](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc) via RapidAPI to fetch a large catalog of free-to-play titles, each with metadata such as genre, platform, publisher, developer, release date, and a direct link to the game's official page. Users can browse this catalog in several ways: a home page featuring a rotating image showcase of highlighted games alongside a spotlight card that cycles through the library, a dedicated Games page with real-time genre filtering, and a carousel-based section that groups games by category.

Authentication is handled entirely through Firebase Auth, supporting both email/password registration and login as well as Google Sign-In. Every user has a private Favorites list backed by Firestore, where they can add and remove games that interest them. The favorites persist across sessions and are tied to the authenticated user's account.

The UI is organized around a persistent navigation bar with a responsive hamburger menu, a footer with social links, and a global alert system powered by SweetAlert2. Active game details open in an overlay panel — the `ActiveGame` component — that adjusts its available actions depending on the current route (add to favorites on the explore page, remove from favorites on the favorites page). A custom disk-style card component (`DiskGame`) animates on click to reveal extended game information inline.

State is managed globally with Redux Toolkit across three slices: `auth` (user session, login images, error messages), `games` (full catalog, categories, favorites, active game), and `ui` (navbar open state, filter open state, SweetAlert2 alerts). Components never dispatch directly — they interact with the store exclusively through custom hooks (`useAuthStore`, `useGamesStore`, `useUiStore`), keeping the component layer clean and testable.

The project is fully tested with Jest and React Testing Library, covering components, pages, services, and helpers with a minimum 70% coverage threshold across all metrics. Pre-commit hooks via Husky and lint-staged enforce ESLint and Prettier automatically on every commit.

## Getting Started

With the stack outlined above, follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Execute: `npm install`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your RapidAPI and Firebase credentials
5. Execute: `npm run dev`

The application will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

With the app running locally, you can verify everything works by exercising the test suite.

1. Navigate to the project folder
2. Execute: `npm test`

For coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Security Audit

Beyond functional tests, the project ships with tooling to audit dependencies and overall code health.

### npm audit

Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies:

```bash
npm audit
```

### React Doctor

Run a health check on the project (security, performance, dead code, architecture):

```bash
npm run doctor
```

Use `--verbose` to see specific files and line numbers:

```bash
npm run doctor -- --verbose
```

## Known Issues

None at the moment.
